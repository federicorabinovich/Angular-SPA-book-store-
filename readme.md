Instructions for deploying:

1) just download the whole repository and keep the same folder structure
2) upload it to your favorite server

that's it.


You can find the original directions forr this task in the following paragraphs 



Create a SPA, that displays the books available in the `books.json` file in this Gist.
An example wireframe is also attached to this Gist, but please feel free to deviate and be as creative as you like.

### Requirements

This is a small 2 page SPA, consisting of an index page (list of books) and a show page (detailed view of each book).

* The books index page should be:

    - Filterable (by category and genre)
    - Searchable (by title and author)
    - Pageable (either frontend or backend pagination is fine for this)

* The books index page should show the following data for each book:

    - Cover image
    - Title
    - Author
    - Votes
    - Published date (bonus points for relative time)

* When a book is clicked it then displays the books show page.

* The books show page should display the same data visible from the index page with the addition of:

    - Author avatar
    - Introductory contents
    - 3 recommended books (from a similar genre and category)

* Your implementation should be provided as a public Github repository, with instructions on how to run the code locally.

### What we'll be looking at

* The structure, modularity and overall quality of any code and markup.
* The suitability of the chosen technologies
* Documentation
* Creativity
